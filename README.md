# Ikea Queens Returns

Just a python program to update me on if the returns department at Ikea Queens, New York is open.

BG- The Queens Ikea store hasn't resumed the returns department since the Ida Flooding. I wrote this program to send me an update every two hours on if the store has resumed the returns department.



### This program saves me the hastle of repeating the process over and over again!

Tools used- Selenium, BeautifulSoup and SMTP protocol client.
